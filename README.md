## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** (>= 3.8)
- **Poetry** (for dependency management and virtual environment setup)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanielBibby/Snake.git
   cd Snake

2. Install dependencies
   ``` bash
   poetry install

3. Activate poetry venv
   ```
   poetry shell

4. Install the vnenv as a Jupyter Kernel
   ```
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=snake --display-name "Python (snake)"

5. Read notbooks/Report.ipynb for a concise report of my work so far. For 
   details on what I'm currently working on see the other
   notbook files, these will not be as well-documented but
   are still readable. Avoid running code freely in these as there
   may be computationally expensive code.
   ```
   jupyter notbook
